# Undetected Playwright Python CF Solver

This repository contains a Python script that sends a POST request to an API, extracts the cookie and user agent, and uses Playwright to set these cookies and user agent in a browser session while navigating to a specified URL through a proxy.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/python/docs/intro) for Python
- Required Python packages (listed in `requirements.txt`)

## Code example
```python
async with async_playwright() as p:
    cookie_object, user_agent, proxy_obj = get_cookies_and_user_agent(API_KEY, TARGET_URL, 
        PROXY_URL, version=126, browser_name='chrome')

    for browser_type in [p.chromium]:
        browser = await browser_type.launch(headless=False, proxy=proxy_obj, channel='chrome')
        context = await browser.new_context(user_agent=user_agent)
        page = await context.new_page()
        
        await context.add_cookies(cookie_object)
        await page.goto(TARGET_URL)
        await browser.close()
```

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/pim97/undetected-playwright-python-bypass-cloudflare.git
    cd repo-name
    ```

2. **Install the required packages:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Install Playwright browsers:**

    ```bash
    playwright install
    ```

## Usage

1. **Set your API key and proxy URL:**

    In the script, replace `YOUR_API_KEY_HERE` with your actual API key and update the `proxy_url` with your proxy details:

    ```python
    API_KEY = "API_KEY_HERE"
    TARGET_URL = "https://"
    PROXY_URL = 'http://user:pass@host:ip'
    ```

2. **Run the script:**

    ```bash
    python script.py
    ```

    This will execute the script, sending a POST request to the API, extracting the cookie and user agent, and using Playwright to set these cookies and user agent in a browser session while navigating to the specified URL.

## Script Breakdown

- **Step 1:** Send a POST request to the API and extract the cookie and user agent from the response.
- **Step 2:** Parse the target URL to extract the domain.
- **Step 3:** Use Playwright to launch a browser, set the extracted cookie and user agent, and navigate to the specified URL through the provided proxy.
